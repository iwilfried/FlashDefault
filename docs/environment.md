## Set-Up 

?> Whatâ€™s Flutter?  

<p>Developed by Google, Flutter is a mobile app SDK, which allows developers to develop high-quality native interfaces for iOS, Android, Web, macOS, and Linux devices using a single codebase. It allows developers to write a code once and use it on different software devices.</p> 

Flutter is a free and open-source framework. The amazing features of Flutter enhance the mobile app development experiences.

Therefore, Flutter is the best choice for every startup.


### Minimum Requirements

- Operating Systems: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)
- Disk Space: At least 400 MB.
- Tools: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment.

### Installing Chocolatey

?> On windows, the easiest way to install Flutter is via the package manager <strong>Chocolatey</strong>.  
<p>With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted.</br>
Run the following command in Windows Powershell</p>

```
C:\>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

<p>If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey!</p>

> C:\> **choco**

<pre><i>Chocolatey v1.1.0    
Please run 'choco -?' or 'choco <command> -?' for help menu.</i></pre></br> 

`With Chocolatey on your machine, you simply have to run:`


> C:\> **choco install flutter**
